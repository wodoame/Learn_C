/* A format specifier is a placeholder in a format string that specifies the type of data to be printed or read. 
They are used with functions such as printf, scanf, fprintf, and fscanf to determine
 how the data should be displayed or interpreted.
 The format specifier starts with a % symbol, followed by a character that represents 
the type of data to be displayed (e.g. %d for an integer, %f for a floating point number, %s for a string, etc.).

Here are some common format specifiers in C:
%d or %i: signed decimal integer
%u: unsigned decimal integer
%f: floating point decimal number
%e: floating point number in scientific notation
%g: use either %f or %e, whichever is shorter
%c: character
%s: string of characters
%x: unsigned hexadecimal number
%o: unsigned octal number
%%: print a literal % character
