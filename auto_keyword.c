/* In C, the auto keyword is used to declare a variable with automatic storage duration. 
   This means that the variable is allocated on the stack and its lifetime is tied to the scope in which it is declared. */

/* In practice, the auto keyword is rarely used in C because it is the default storage class for variables declared inside a function. 
   This means that if you do not specify a storage class for a variable, it will be treated as an automatic variable by default. */

/* However, the auto keyword can still be used to make the storage class of a variable explicit, which can be useful for readability and maintainability. */
